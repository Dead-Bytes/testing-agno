So we can confirm the input hashes are indeed measured by the RA quote.\\n\\n### The Base Image\\n\\nPoint 2 and 3 can be proved by two steps. First, check that the measurements of the base image ( `RTMR0-2`, and `root-fs-hash` in `RTMR3`) are genuine. Second, you can extract the published base image to inspect everything inside.\\n\\nTo compare the measurements with the golden values, you can relaunch the CVM with the same configurations to reproduce the measurements, and they should be exact bit-for-bit matched the ones in the RA quote. The base image can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Phala-Network/meta-dstack/releases/tag/v0.1.0), and you can follow [the README of Dstack](https://github.com/Phala-Network/dstack/) to relaunch the CVM.\\n\\nThen you can inspect the image binary to check there\\u2019s no backdoor and the OS will loads the right docker image after booting.\\n\\nAdditionally, the base image is built from an Yocto configuration, [meta-dstack](https://github.com/Phala-Network/meta-dstack). Yocto brings two benefits. First, it produces a minimized customized OS image without any unused features. It minimized the TCB (the components you have to trust) and reduces the potential attacking surface.

It defines the actual program running in the TEE.\\n\\nThe `docker-compose` file includes the docker image (with the hash), the startup arguments, and the environment variables of the application to launch. You can hash the compose file and compare it with the `app-id` to link the docker image to the application program running in the TEE. Here\\u2019s a part of the compose file:\\n\\n```yaml\\nversion: '3.9'\\nservices:\\n  twitter:\\n    image: teeheehee/err_err_ttyl@sha256:50c3f8a00bbc47533504b026698e1e6409b4938109506c4e5a3baaae95116eb7\\n    volumes:\\n      - /var/run/tappd.sock:/var/run/tappd.sock\\n    environment:\\n\\t    # ....\\n```\\n\\nYou can follow the image hash on Docker Hub to download the image file to inspect.

However, in the the current deployed Dstack, the file is also used to pass secrets to the application by environment variables. The variables include API keys and other secrets that cannot be shared.\\n\\n\\u26a0\\ufe0f\\n\\nThe wallet key is not part of the secret inputs. According to the source code, it\\u2019s fully generated inside the TEE.\\n\\nWe need to prove the compose file matches the measured `app-id` hash, and the image is the correct one, but without revealing the secret. To do that, we can generate a Zero Knowledge Proof using Risc Zero zkVM:\",\n    \"meta_data\": {\n      \"chunk_index\": 6.0,\n      \"datasource\": \"WEBSITE\",\n      \"end_byte\": 18316.0,\n      \"file_path\": \"https://phala.network/posts/truth-of-AI-Agent\",\n      \"id\": \"https://phala.network/posts/truth-of-AI-Agent_6\",\n      \"knowledge_id\": \"6b1e926e-0897-478d-8973-7c599f5e9fa8\",\n      \"start_byte\": 15189.0,\n      \"text\": \"By feeding the three hashes to `rtmr_replay`, it outputs the exact same hash as what you can find in the RA quote. So we can confirm the input hashes are indeed measured by the RA quote.\\n\\n### The Base Image\\n\\nPoint 2 and 3 can be proved by two steps. First, check that the measurements of the base image ( `RTMR0-2`, and `root-fs-hash` in `RTMR3`) are genuine. Second, you can extract the published base image to inspect everything inside.\\n\\nTo compare the measurements with the golden values, you can relaunch the CVM with the same configurations to reproduce the measurements, and they should be exact bit-for-bit matched the ones in the RA quote. The base image can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Phala-Network/meta-dstack/releases/tag/v0.1.0), and you can follow [the README of Dstack](https://github.com/Phala-Network/dstack/) to relaunch the CVM.\\n\\nThen you can inspect the image binary to check there\\u2019s no backdoor and the OS will loads the right docker image after booting.\\n\\nAdditionally, the base image is built from an Yocto configuration, [meta-dstack](https://github.com/Phala-Network/meta-dstack). Yocto brings two benefits. First, it produces a minimized customized OS image without any unused features. It minimized the TCB (the components you have to trust) and reduces the potential attacking surface. Second, when configured correctly, Yocto can enable bit-for-bit reproducible build for the base image. (Currently it\\u2019s not fully reproducible. We aim to achieve it soon.)\\n\\n### The Docker Application\\n\\nPoint 4 can be proved by checking the `app-id` in `RTMR3`. It measures the sha256 hash of the `docker-compose.yml` file.

When traditional servers run these agents, they typically store sensitive info like passwords and private keys.

So we can confirm the input hashes are indeed measured by the RA quote.\\n\\n### The Base Image\\n\\nPoint 2 and 3 can be proved by two steps. First, check that the measurements of the base image ( `RTMR0-2`, and `root-fs-hash` in `RTMR3`) are genuine. Second, you can extract the published base image to inspect everything inside.\\n\\nTo compare the measurements with the golden values, you can relaunch the CVM with the same configurations to reproduce the measurements, and they should be exact bit-for-bit matched the ones in the RA quote. The base image can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Phala-Network/meta-dstack/releases/tag/v0.1.0), and you can follow [the README of Dstack](https://github.com/Phala-Network/dstack/) to relaunch the CVM.\\n\\nThen you can inspect the image binary to check there\\u2019s no backdoor and the OS will loads the right docker image after booting.\\n\\nAdditionally, the base image is built from an Yocto configuration, [meta-dstack](https://github.com/Phala-Network/meta-dstack). Yocto brings two benefits. First, it produces a minimized customized OS image without any unused features. It minimized the TCB (the components you have to trust) and reduces the potential attacking surface. Second, when configured correctly, Yocto can enable bit-for-bit reproducible build for the base image. (Currently it\\u2019s not fully reproducible. We aim to achieve it soon.)\\n\\n### The Docker Application\\n\\nPoint 4 can be proved by checking the `app-id` in `RTMR3`. It measures the sha256 hash of the `docker-compose.yml` file.

However, in the the current deployed Dstack, the file is also used to pass secrets to the application by environment variables. The variables include API keys and other secrets that cannot be shared.\\n\\n\\u26a0\\ufe0f\\n\\nThe wallet key is not part of the secret inputs. According to the source code, it\\u2019s fully generated inside the TEE.\\n\\nWe need to prove the compose file matches the measured `app-id` hash, and the image is the correct one, but without revealing the secret. To do that, we can generate a Zero Knowledge Proof using Risc Zero zkVM:\",\n    \"meta_data\": {\n      \"chunk_index\": 6.0,\n      \"datasource\": \"WEBSITE\",\n      \"end_byte\": 18316.0,\n      \"file_path\": \"https://phala.network/posts/truth-of-AI-Agent\",\n      \"id\": \"https://phala.network/posts/truth-of-AI-Agent_6\",\n      \"knowledge_id\": \"6b1e926e-0897-478d-8973-7c599f5e9fa8\",\n      \"start_byte\": 15189.0,\n      \"text\": \"By feeding the three hashes to `rtmr_replay`, it outputs the exact same hash as what you can find in the RA quote. So we can confirm the input hashes are indeed measured by the RA quote.\\n\\n### The Base Image\\n\\nPoint 2 and 3 can be proved by two steps. First, check that the measurements of the base image ( `RTMR0-2`, and `root-fs-hash` in `RTMR3`) are genuine. Second, you can extract the published base image to inspect everything inside.\\n\\nTo compare the measurements with the golden values, you can relaunch the CVM with the same configurations to reproduce the measurements, and they should be exact bit-for-bit matched the ones in the RA quote. The base image can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Phala-Network/meta-dstack/releases/tag/v0.1.0), and you can follow [the README of Dstack](https://github.com/Phala-Network/dstack/) to relaunch the CVM.\\n\\nThen you can inspect the image binary to check there\\u2019s no backdoor and the OS will loads the right docker image after booting.\\n\\nAdditionally, the base image is built from an Yocto configuration, [meta-dstack](https://github.com/Phala-Network/meta-dstack). Yocto brings two benefits. First, it produces a minimized customized OS image without any unused features. It minimized the TCB (the components you have to trust) and reduces the potential attacking surface. Second, when configured correctly, Yocto can enable bit-for-bit reproducible build for the base image. (Currently it\\u2019s not fully reproducible. We aim to achieve it soon.)\\n\\n### The Docker Application\\n\\nPoint 4 can be proved by checking the `app-id` in `RTMR3`. It measures the sha256 hash of the `docker-compose.yml` file. It defines the actual program running in the TEE.\\n\\nThe `docker-compose` file includes the docker image (with the hash), the startup arguments, and the environment variables of the application to launch.

After the boot, the CVM does nothing other than load the right program (defined in a docker-compose file)\\n\\n### The Hardware\\n\\nPoint 1 is covered by the [RA quote](https://dstack-sim-explorer.vercel.app/) generated by the hardware, since nobody can produce a fake RA quote unless the TEE is considered broken.\\n\\n![](https://img0.phala.world/files/12f0317e-04a1-807c-b01a-df16c8af2814.jpg)\\n\\n### RTMRs\\n\\nBefore moving to the other points, we need to check what a RA quote contains. The most important fields are RTMRs (runtime measurement registers). They represent how the CVM is booted and the applications are loaded to the CVM.\",\n      \"title\": \"We Know the Truth of AI Agent\",\n      \"url\": \"https://phala.network/posts/truth-of-AI-Agent\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"content\": \"By feeding the three hashes to `rtmr_replay`, it outputs the exact same hash as what you can find in the RA quote. So we can confirm the input hashes are indeed measured by the RA quote.\\n\\n### The Base Image\\n\\nPoint 2 and 3 can be proved by two steps. First, check that the measurements of the base image ( `RTMR0-2`, and `root-fs-hash` in `RTMR3`) are genuine. Second, you can extract the published base image to inspect everything inside.\\n\\nTo compare the measurements with the golden values, you can relaunch the CVM with the same configurations to reproduce the measurements, and they should be exact bit-for-bit matched the ones in the RA quote. The base image can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Phala-Network/meta-dstack/releases/tag/v0.1.0), and you can follow [the README of Dstack](https://github.com/Phala-Network/dstack/) to relaunch the CVM.\\n\\nThen you can inspect the image binary to check there\\u2019s no backdoor and the OS will loads the right docker image after booting.\\n\\nAdditionally, the base image is built from an Yocto configuration, [meta-dstack](https://github.com/Phala-Network/meta-dstack). Yocto brings two benefits. First, it produces a minimized customized OS image without any unused features. It minimized the TCB (the components you have to trust) and reduces the potential attacking surface. Second, when configured correctly, Yocto can enable bit-for-bit reproducible build for the base image. (Currently it\\u2019s not fully reproducible. We aim to achieve it soon.)\\n\\n### The Docker Application\\n\\nPoint 4 can be proved by checking the `app-id` in `RTMR3`. It measures the sha256 hash of the `docker-compose.yml` file. It defines the actual program running in the TEE.\\n\\nThe `docker-compose` file includes the docker image (with the hash), the startup arguments, and the environment variables of the application to launch. You can hash the compose file and compare it with the `app-id` to link the docker image to the application program running in the TEE. Here\\u2019s a part of the compose file:\\n\\n```yaml\\nversion: '3.9'\\nservices:\\n  twitter:\\n    image: teeheehee/err_err_ttyl@sha256:50c3f8a00bbc47533504b026698e1e6409b4938109506c4e5a3baaae95116eb7\\n    volumes:\\n      - /var/run/tappd.sock:/var/run/tappd.sock\\n    environment:\\n\\t    # ....\\n```\\n\\nYou can follow the image hash on Docker Hub to download the image file to inspect. In the future, we encourage people to make fully reproducible Docker image to add more credibility.\\n\\n### Verifying the Docker Compose file\\n\\nOne can easily verify the docker compose file against the RA quote if they have the compose file contents. However, in the the current deployed Dstack, the file is also used to pass secrets to the application by environment variables. The variables include API keys and other secrets that cannot be shared.\\n\\n\\u26a0\\ufe0f\\n\\nThe wallet key is not part of the secret inputs. According to the source code, it\\u2019s fully generated inside the TEE.\\n\\nWe need to prove the compose file matches the measured `app-id` hash, and the image is the correct one, but without revealing the secret. To do that, we can generate a Zero Knowledge Proof using Risc Zero zkVM:\",\n    \"meta_data\": {\n      \"chunk_index\": 6.0,\n      \"datasource\": \"WEBSITE\",\n      \"end_byte\": 18316.0,\n      \"file_path\": \"https://phala.network/posts/truth-of-AI-Agent\",\n      \"id\": \"https://phala.network/posts/truth-of-AI-Agent_6\",\n      \"knowledge_id\": \"6b1e926e-0897-478d-8973-7c599f5e9fa8\",\n      \"start_byte\": 15189.0,\n      \"text\": \"By feeding the three hashes to `rtmr_replay`, it outputs the exact same hash as what you can find in the RA quote.

We knew the truth, because the AI is running inside TEE.\n\nBut let’s dig into some specifics about TEE\\_HEE’s setup, why TEE matters, and how it guarantees authenticity in a way that’s unforgeable:\n\n### Why TEE is Essential for Secure AI Agents\n\nAI agents, even autonomous ones like TEE\\_HEE, are ultimately software running on hardware, meaning they need somewhere to live—like a server. When traditional servers run these agents, they typically store sensitive info like passwords and private keys. Here’s where things can go wrong: the server owner can technically “rug” the agent by accessing or controlling its sensitive data.\n\n## Enter TEE: The Unruggable Tech Vault 🔒\n\nTEE is a hardware-based secure enclave, like a “black box” that locks away sensitive data and ensures only the designated program can access it. Here’s how it works in plain terms:\n\n- **Right Code** \\- TEE only allows specific, verifiable code to run in it, much like how smart contracts are public and verifiable on Etherscan.\n\n- **Secure Black Box** \\- This verifiable code can only execute within the TEE, ensuring it operates without interference, making it “unruggable.”\n\n### How Remote Attestation Builds Trust 🔗\n\nRemote Attestation (RA) is where TEE proves its integrity. It generates an unforgeable claim that shows exactly what’s running inside it. This attestation includes key details:\n\n**TEE Signature** \\- The RA is signed by the TEE itself, and only the TEE can generate this signature.\n\n**Code Hash** \\- The attestation contains a hash of the code, letting anyone verify it hasn’t been tampered with.\n\n**Cryptographic Key Commitment** \\- The attestation includes a key that allows verifiable actions like transactions or messages, signed by the AI agent itself.\n\nWith RA, anyone can confirm that TEE\\_HEE is operating solely according to the public code, without interference from any third party—including its creators. Here’s a [sample attestation](https://dstack-sim-explorer.vercel.app/) to explore how it works.\n\n### Now, What’s the Deal with $TEE? 🤔",

We knew the truth, because the AI is running inside TEE.\n\nBut let’s dig into some specifics about TEE\\_HEE’s setup, why TEE matters, and how it guarantees authenticity in a way that’s unforgeable:\n\n### Why TEE is Essential for Secure AI Agents\n\nAI agents, even autonomous ones like TEE\\_HEE, are ultimately software running on hardware, meaning they need somewhere to live—like a server. When traditional servers run these agents, they typically store sensitive info like passwords and private keys. Here’s where things can go wrong: the server owner can technically “rug” the agent by accessing or controlling its sensitive data.\n\n## Enter TEE: The Unruggable Tech Vault 🔒\n\nTEE is a hardware-based secure enclave, like a “black box” that locks away sensitive data and ensures only the designated program can access it. Here’s how it works in plain terms:\n\n- **Right Code** \\- TEE only allows specific, verifiable code to run in it, much like how smart contracts are public and verifiable on Etherscan.\n\n- **Secure Black Box** \\- This verifiable code can only execute within the TEE, ensuring it operates without interference, making it “unruggable.”\n\n### How Remote Attestation Builds Trust 🔗\n\nRemote Attestation (RA) is where TEE proves its integrity. It generates an unforgeable claim that shows exactly what’s running inside it. This attestation includes key details:\n\n**TEE Signature** \\- The RA is signed by the TEE itself, and only the TEE can generate this signature.\n\n**Code Hash** \\- The attestation contains a hash of the code, letting anyone verify it hasn’t been tampered with.\n\n**Cryptographic Key Commitment** \\- The attestation includes a key that allows verifiable actions like transactions or messages, signed by the AI agent itself.\n\nWith RA, anyone can confirm that TEE\\_HEE is operating solely according to the public code, without interference from any third party—including its creators. Here’s a [sample attestation](https://dstack-sim-explorer.vercel.app/) to explore how it works.\n\n### Now, What’s the Deal with $TEE? 🤔",

So we can confirm the input hashes are indeed measured by the RA quote.\n\n### The Base Image\n\nPoint 2 and 3 can be proved by two steps. First, check that the measurements of the base image ( `RTMR0-2`, and `root-fs-hash` in `RTMR3`) are genuine. Second, you can extract the published base image to inspect everything inside.\n\nTo compare the measurements with the golden values, you can relaunch the CVM with the same configurations to reproduce the measurements, and they should be exact bit-for-bit matched the ones in the RA quote. The base image can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Phala-Network/meta-dstack/releases/tag/v0.1.0), and you can follow [the README of Dstack](https://github.com/Phala-Network/dstack/) to relaunch the CVM.\n\nThen you can inspect the image binary to check there’s no backdoor and the OS will loads the right docker image after booting.\n\nAdditionally, the base image is built from an Yocto configuration, [meta-dstack](https://github.com/Phala-Network/meta-dstack). Yocto brings two benefits. First, it produces a minimized customized OS image without any unused features. It minimized the TCB (the components you have to trust) and reduces the potential attacking surface. Second, when configured correctly, Yocto can enable bit-for-bit reproducible build for the base image. (Currently it’s not fully reproducible. We aim to achieve it soon.)\n\n### The Docker Application\n\nPoint 4 can be proved by checking the `app-id` in `RTMR3`. It measures the sha256 hash of the `docker-compose.yml` file. It defines the actual program running in the TEE.\n\nThe `docker-compose` file includes the docker image (with the hash), the startup arguments, and the environment variables of the application to launch. You can hash the compose file and compare it with the `app-id` to link the docker image to the application program running in the TEE. Here’s a part of the compose file:\n\n```yaml\nversion: '3.9'\nservices:\n  twitter:\n    image: teeheehee/err_err_ttyl@sha256:50c3f8a00bbc47533504b026698e1e6409b4938109506c4e5a3baaae95116eb7\n    volumes:\n      - /var/run/tappd.sock:/var/run/tappd.sock\n    environment:\n\t    # ....\n```\n\nYou can follow the image hash on Docker Hub to download the image file to inspect. In the future, we encourage people to make fully reproducible Docker image to add more credibility.\n\n### Verifying the Docker Compose file\n\nOne can easily verify the docker compose file against the RA quote if they have the compose file contents. However, in the the current deployed Dstack, the file is also used to pass secrets to the application by environment variables. The variables include API keys and other secrets that cannot be shared.\n\n⚠️\n\nThe wallet key is not part of the secret inputs. According to the source code, it’s fully generated inside the TEE.\n\nWe need to prove the compose file matches the measured `app-id` hash, and the image is the correct one, but without revealing the secret. To do that, we can generate a Zero Knowledge Proof using Risc Zero zkVM:",

We use TEE to guarantee the right program (in this case, the TEE-HEE-HE AI Agent) is running on the genuine hardware (Intel TDX).

For example, we showed that anyone can verify the full supply chain of the code by checking the base image dumped from our server, the ZKP of the docker compose file, and of course, the Remote Attestation generated by the TEE. With everything set up properly, the AI Agent becomes a truly autonomous agent that can access both web2 and web3.\n\n[Phala Network and Ava Protocol Partner to Safeguard Transaction Confidentiality in Web3](https://phala.network/posts/phala-network-and-ava-protocol-partner-to-safeguard-transaction-confidentiality-in-web3) [Launch Eliza V2 Beta Agent Swarms with TEE Security on Phala Cloud](https://phala.network/posts/launch-eliza-v2-beta-agent-swarms-with-tee-security-on-phala-cloud)\n\n# About Phala\n\nPhala Network is a decentralized cloud that offers secure and scalable computing for Web3.\n\nWith Phat Contracts, an innovative programming model enabling trustless off-chain computation, developers can create new Web3 use cases.\n\n[Subscribe](https://phala.network/posts/truth-of-AI-Agent#section-subscription) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PhalaNetwork) [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@PhalaNetwork) [Github](https://github.com/phala-Network)\n\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/phala-network) [Forum](https://forum.phala.network/) [Telegram](https://t.me/phalanetwork)\n\n# Recent Posts",

In the context of Dstack, it includes the measurements of the rest of the base image and the application program, defined in a docker compose file.\n\nRTMR contains everything you need to verify the quote. Let’s decode [the RA quote file](https://github.com/tee-he-he/err_err_ttyl/blob/main/quote.hex) using the [dcap-qvl cli tool](https://github.com/Phala-Network/dcap-qvl/tree/master/cli):\n\n```bash\n{\n      \"rt_mr0\": \"4574c098915caf3e82057817dbd135c1ed0ee1b39ac300c921479e2f5ebf5726a13ee0c8745ac891b6aee7c4f9664610\",\n      \"rt_mr1\": \"000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\n      \"rt_mr2\": \"000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\n      \"rt_mr3\": \"547fcba4630bfb981169a8a1903b79c244933413409dd0387acbd8e3b985bcc9164cf52735cd31f60bf2c5d1220c113f\",\n}\n```\n\nTo verify the content of `RTMR3`, we need to extract the log entries from the CVM outputs, reply the logs to get the final hash, and confirm it matches the `RTMR3` registry in the quote.

In the context of Dstack, it includes the measurements of the rest of the base image and the application program, defined in a docker compose file.\n\nRTMR contains everything you need to verify the quote. Let’s decode [the RA quote file](https://github.com/tee-he-he/err_err_ttyl/blob/main/quote.hex) using the [dcap-qvl cli tool](https://github.com/Phala-Network/dcap-qvl/tree/master/cli):\n\n```bash\n{\n      \"rt_mr0\": \"4574c098915caf3e82057817dbd135c1ed0ee1b39ac300c921479e2f5ebf5726a13ee0c8745ac891b6aee7c4f9664610\",\n      \"rt_mr1\": \"000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\n      \"rt_mr2\": \"000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\n      \"rt_mr3\": \"547fcba4630bfb981169a8a1903b79c244933413409dd0387acbd8e3b985bcc9164cf52735cd31f60bf2c5d1220c113f\",\n}\n```\n\nTo verify the content of `RTMR3`, we need to extract the log entries from the CVM outputs, reply the logs to get the final hash, and confirm it matches the `RTMR3` registry in the quote. Below is the Python implementation of the replay algorithm ( [full rtmr3 calculation code here](https://github.com/Phala-Network/meta-dstack/blob/main/scripts/calc_rtmr3.py)):\n\n```python\nINIT_MR=\"000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\"\ndef rtmr_replay(history: list[str]):\n    if len(history) == 0:\n        return INIT_MR\n    mr = bytes.fromhex(INIT_MR)\n    for content in history:\n        content = bytes.fromhex(content)\n        if len(content) < 48:\n            content = content.ljust(48, b'\\0')\n        mr = hashlib.sha384(mr + content).digest()\n    return mr.hex()\n```\n\nIn the context of Dstack, `RTMR3` includes three measurements:\n\n```python\nroot-fs-hash: 5ec11fc7e2dc52c02d5b9b255ba7af1241904d2efdb9f4f05a055ab9312f0bde\napp-id: 70ec07c39cd7cfb1672318bd586b37ee2f7133c4f3f41b948289db8d93fe2c4b\nca-certificate-hash: ca0d145f119f02b3da10ec0fb3cb75857e66dfcc738b9be6cf9f877a0aff0628\n```",

When traditional servers run these agents, they typically store sensitive info like passwords and private keys. Here’s where things can go wrong: the server owner can technically “rug” the agent by accessing or controlling its sensitive data.\n\n## Enter TEE: The Unruggable Tech Vault 🔒\n\nTEE is a hardware-based secure enclave, like a “black box” that locks away sensitive data and ensures only the designated program can access it. Here’s how it works in plain terms:\n\n- **Right Code** \\- TEE only allows specific, verifiable code to run in it, much like how smart contracts are public and verifiable on Etherscan.\n\n- **Secure Black Box** \\- This verifiable code can only execute within the TEE, ensuring it operates without interference, making it “unruggable.”\n\n### How Remote Attestation Builds Trust 🔗\n\nRemote Attestation (RA) is where TEE proves its integrity. It generates an unforgeable claim that shows exactly what’s running inside it. This attestation includes key details:\n\n**TEE Signature** \\- The RA is signed by the TEE itself, and only the TEE can generate this signature.\n\n**Code Hash** \\- The attestation contains a hash of the code, letting anyone verify it hasn’t been tampered with.\n\n**Cryptographic Key Commitment** \\- The attestation includes a key that allows verifiable actions like transactions or messages, signed by the AI agent itself.\n\nWith RA, anyone can confirm that TEE\\_HEE is operating solely according to the public code, without interference from any third party—including its creators.

For example, we showed that anyone can verify the full supply chain of the code by checking the base image dumped from our server, the ZKP of the docker compose file, and of course, the Remote Attestation generated by the TEE. With everything set up properly, the AI Agent becomes a truly autonomous agent that can access both web2 and web3.\n\n[Phala Network and Ava Protocol Partner to Safeguard Transaction Confidentiality in Web3](https://phala.network/posts/phala-network-and-ava-protocol-partner-to-safeguard-transaction-confidentiality-in-web3) [Launch Eliza V2 Beta Agent Swarms with TEE Security on Phala Cloud](https://phala.network/posts/launch-eliza-v2-beta-agent-swarms-with-tee-security-on-phala-cloud)\n\n# About Phala\n\nPhala Network is a decentralized cloud that offers secure and scalable computing for Web3.\n\nWith Phat Contracts, an innovative programming model enabling trustless off-chain computation, developers can create new Web3 use cases.\n\n[Subscribe](https://phala.network/posts/truth-of-AI-Agent#section-subscription) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PhalaNetwork) [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@PhalaNetwork) [Github](https://github.com/phala-Network)\n\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/phala-network) [Forum](https://forum.phala.network/) [Telegram](https://t.me/phalanetwork)\n\n# Recent Posts",

With everything set up properly, the AI Agent becomes a truly autonomous agent that can access both web2 and web3.\n\n[Phala Network and Ava Protocol Partner to Safeguard Transaction Confidentiality in Web3](https://phala.network/posts/phala-network-and-ava-protocol-partner-to-safeguard-transaction-confidentiality-in-web3) [Launch Eliza V2 Beta Agent Swarms with TEE Security on Phala Cloud](https://phala.network/posts/launch-eliza-v2-beta-agent-swarms-with-tee-security-on-phala-cloud)\n\n# About Phala\n\nPhala Network is a decentralized cloud that offers secure and scalable computing for Web3.\n\nWith Phat Contracts, an innovative programming model enabling trustless off-chain computation, developers can create new Web3 use cases.\n\n[Subscribe](https://phala.network/posts/truth-of-AI-Agent#section-subscription) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PhalaNetwork) [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@PhalaNetwork) [Github](https://github.com/phala-Network)\n\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/phala-network) [Forum](https://forum.phala.network/) [Telegram](https://t.me/phalanetwork)\n\n# Recent Posts",

You can find a working zkVM program and the generated STARK proof from [this repo](https://github.com/h4x3rotab/partial-ra-zkp).\n\nFor now, ZKP is the super weapon to solve the secret problem. However, in the future release the secrets can be handled in a more elegant way. So that we only need simple hashing to prove the code supply chain.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTEE like Intel TDX provides the tamper-proof and privacy-preserving features to AI Agent. We use TEE to guarantee the right program (in this case, the TEE-HEE-HE AI Agent) is running on the genuine hardware (Intel TDX). So even the operating system or hackers with physical access to the hardware cannot tamper with the agent.\n\nThe AI Agent uses Dstack with almost all the best practices to maintain its security properties. For example, we showed that anyone can verify the full supply chain of the code by checking the base image dumped from our server, the ZKP of the docker compose file, and of course, the Remote Attestation generated by the TEE. With everything set up properly, the AI Agent becomes a truly autonomous agent that can access both web2 and web3.\n\n[Phala Network and Ava Protocol Partner to Safeguard Transaction Confidentiality in Web3](https://phala.network/posts/phala-network-and-ava-protocol-partner-to-safeguard-transaction-confidentiality-in-web3) [Launch Eliza V2 Beta Agent Swarms with TEE Security on Phala Cloud](https://phala.network/posts/launch-eliza-v2-beta-agent-swarms-with-tee-security-on-phala-cloud)\n\n# About Phala\n\nPhala Network is a decentralized cloud that offers secure and scalable computing for Web3.\n\nWith Phat Contracts, an innovative programming model enabling trustless off-chain computation, developers can create new Web3 use cases.\n\n[Subscribe](https://phala.network/posts/truth-of-AI-Agent#section-subscription) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PhalaNetwork) [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@PhalaNetwork) [Github](https://github.com/phala-Network)\n\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/phala-network) [Forum](https://forum.phala.network/) [Telegram](https://t.me/phalanetwork)\n\n# Recent Posts",

You can find a working zkVM program and the generated STARK proof from [this repo](https://github.com/h4x3rotab/partial-ra-zkp).\n\nFor now, ZKP is the super weapon to solve the secret problem. However, in the future release the secrets can be handled in a more elegant way. So that we only need simple hashing to prove the code supply chain.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTEE like Intel TDX provides the tamper-proof and privacy-preserving features to AI Agent. We use TEE to guarantee the right program (in this case, the TEE-HEE-HE AI Agent) is running on the genuine hardware (Intel TDX). So even the operating system or hackers with physical access to the hardware cannot tamper with the agent.\n\nThe AI Agent uses Dstack with almost all the best practices to maintain its security properties. For example, we showed that anyone can verify the full supply chain of the code by checking the base image dumped from our server, the ZKP of the docker compose file, and of course, the Remote Attestation generated by the TEE. With everything set up properly, the AI Agent becomes a truly autonomous agent that can access both web2 and web3.\n\n[Phala Network and Ava Protocol Partner to Safeguard Transaction Confidentiality in Web3](https://phala.network/posts/phala-network-and-ava-protocol-partner-to-safeguard-transaction-confidentiality-in-web3) [Launch Eliza V2 Beta Agent Swarms with TEE Security on Phala Cloud](https://phala.network/posts/launch-eliza-v2-beta-agent-swarms-with-tee-security-on-phala-cloud)\n\n# About Phala\n\nPhala Network is a decentralized cloud that offers secure and scalable computing for Web3.\n\nWith Phat Contracts, an innovative programming model enabling trustless off-chain computation, developers can create new Web3 use cases.\n\n[Subscribe](https://phala.network/posts/truth-of-AI-Agent#section-subscription) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PhalaNetwork) [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@PhalaNetwork) [Github](https://github.com/phala-Network)\n\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/phala-network) [Forum](https://forum.phala.network/) [Telegram](https://t.me/phalanetwork)\n\n# Recent Posts",

In the future, we encourage people to make fully reproducible Docker image to add more credibility.\n\n### Verifying the Docker Compose file\n\nOne can easily verify the docker compose file against the RA quote if they have the compose file contents. However, in the the current deployed Dstack, the file is also used to pass secrets to the application by environment variables. The variables include API keys and other secrets that cannot be shared.\n\n⚠️\n\nThe wallet key is not part of the secret inputs. According to the source code, it’s fully generated inside the TEE.\n\nWe need to prove the compose file matches the measured `app-id` hash, and the image is the correct one, but without revealing the secret.

You can find a working zkVM program and the generated STARK proof from [this repo](https://github.com/h4x3rotab/partial-ra-zkp).\\n\\nFor now, ZKP is the super weapon to solve the secret problem. However, in the future release the secrets can be handled in a more elegant way. So that we only need simple hashing to prove the code supply chain.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nTEE like Intel TDX provides the tamper-proof and privacy-preserving features to AI Agent. We use TEE to guarantee the right program (in this case, the TEE-HEE-HE AI Agent) is running on the genuine hardware (Intel TDX).

Second, when configured correctly, Yocto can enable bit-for-bit reproducible build for the base image. (Currently it\\u2019s not fully reproducible.

It defines the actual program running in the TEE.\\n\\nThe `docker-compose` file includes the docker image (with the hash), the startup arguments, and the environment variables of the application to launch. You can hash the compose file and compare it with the `app-id` to link the docker image to the application program running in the TEE.

According to the source code, it\\u2019s fully generated inside the TEE.\\n\\nWe need to prove the compose file matches the measured `app-id` hash, and the image is the correct one, but without revealing the secret.

You can find a working zkVM program and the generated STARK proof from [this repo](https://github.com/h4x3rotab/partial-ra-zkp).\\n\\nFor now, ZKP is the super weapon to solve the secret problem. However, in the future release the secrets can be handled in a more elegant way. So that we only need simple hashing to prove the code supply chain.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nTEE like Intel TDX provides the tamper-proof and privacy-preserving features to AI Agent. We use TEE to guarantee the right program (in this case, the TEE-HEE-HE AI Agent) is running on the genuine hardware (Intel TDX).

We use TEE to guarantee the right program (in this case, the TEE-HEE-HE AI Agent) is running on the genuine hardware (Intel TDX).
